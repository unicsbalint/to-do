1. Goal of the system:

The goal of the system is to help the people to remember their goals and tasks.
Nowadays there are many ways to help ourselves when it comes to task managing.
Most of these are hard-to-use, and that is the reason why we want our system to be simple yet useful.

 The system needs a database, where the registered users will be stored. For that we
 will use MySQL. The register and login operations will be handled by the server. We use PHP
 to get information from the server and from the database.

 We use Javascript to make complex features possible in our app. The web part is mainly HTML and
 CSS.
