#Introduction
Our goal is to make a one of a kind To-Do list. 
Itâ€™s a well-known thing that our brain can only manage several things even in young age and this only gets worse as you age. 
A To-Do list can help your remember tasks, meetings, deadlines and so on. 
Benefits are endless. 


# Goals of the system:
We would like to make a simple web application that offers a clean and elegant look and functions quickly.

# Description of the current state:
//copied from ReqSpec
Nowadays there are nearly infinite ways to track our actions. Many of which has the same issue, like boring design, 
extremely slow startup or the countless amount of useless features. These apps usually forces you to register to use their product.
Some of these softwares are targeting big companies and teams instead of the small ones, so these people will struggle using apps made for teams of 100s.

# Description of the desired system:
//copied from ReqSpec.
A simple web application in which the users can manage their tasks.
The application will grab the very core of a task managing system therefore increasing efficiency, and will display it in a user-friendly way.
The app can be run without connection to the internet.
The users will be able to add new tasks to the list, complete them and remove the tasks from the list.
They will have the oppurtunity to print these goals.
When adding a new task the users can set deadlines on them.
The users will be able to register to the application with a username and password combination
and after a successful login they will see their name on their tasks and their tasks will be saved.
