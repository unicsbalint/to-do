#Goal of the system:

The goal of the system is to help the people to remember their goals and tasks.
Nowadays there are many ways to help ourselves when it comes to task managing.
Most of these are hard-to-use, and that is the reason why we want our system to be simple yet useful.

#Project plan:

We are making web application using frontend and backend programming. The web applications design and structure
will be the task for the frontend developers. Backend developers will ensure that the website connects to the database
and the functions that uses database connection work.

 to get information from the server and from the database.

 We use Javascript to make complex features possible in our app. The web part is mainly HTML and
 CSS.

 and with the client.
